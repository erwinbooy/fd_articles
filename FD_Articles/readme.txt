This program is completely legal as it just uses the Google search to access the free articles of the FD
People can do this themselves manually but this program just makes it easier

Important notes:
- Don't change the directory structure!
The Directories must look like this:
//FD Articles
--//css (contains the FD css file so we can display the downloaded articles nicely)
--//db (contains the database with all article Urls that we already have)
--//articles (contains the articles that we got from the FD website)
--//bin (contains the jar)

Useful notes:
- If you want to get the articles again you can just remove the url from the database file. Removing the article
itself doesn't do anything.
